**Mission: To provide low-cost products to customers while focusing on the best possible experience**

![](RackMultipart20230226-1-xvd3n9_html_33605f0e37a9cafc.png)

The mission of this company is to provide the best customer  experience, provide low-cost material to customers, and be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. To achieve the best possible customer experience Home Depot  focuses the brand and corporate culture around the consumers which allows the company to have a high retention rate among new consumers, however Home Depot is struggling to turn a profit on the many consumers due to the attempt at bringing

materials and everything to consumers at the lowest possible cost. Furthermore the company builds on the treatment and development of customers to attract other shareholders and investors due to the low amount needed to attract new customers based on the word of others and using it as marketing in their own advantage. Moreover they pride themselves on offering a wide variety of products in a single location allowing them to become a one stop shop for all types of consumers and businesses.

**Objectives: Become an increasingly eco-friendly company for the benefit of consumers and the planet**

Home Depot has been aggressive in their pledges to become a far more environmentally friendly company over the upcoming years as a way to satisfy customers and to continually build their good reputation while building a better and cleaner environment. With Home Depot's most ambitious project and objective being going completely renewable and green by 2030 which is a monumental task across all 2000+ stores and venues that they own across North America. Furthermore Home Depot is actively working with suppliers to reduce plastic waste and is increasing the cost of packaging by researching and investing in alternative products which can be used to safely ship the product to consumers while also helping the environment a the same time.

**Strategies and Policies:**

Currently Home Depot uses a strategy to continuously build goodwill with customers and to further extend their reach by incorporating environmental protection at the cost of profit and research which limits their abilities to improve the processes which are already lacking. The issue with building and growing horizontally is that Home Depot is lacking the profit margins that it could have by increasing the quality and products sold in stores.

R ![](RackMultipart20230226-1-xvd3n9_html_1a2ff5c28b581d56.png) ecommendation 1: **Improve quality of products from suppliers**

By improving the quality of products supplied to the public they are able to increase the amount of profit margins as it allows for an increased payment for the quality of product sold while this may have downsides as it distances some of the poorer community having the options available for better quality at a higher price for other construction companies as well as to more wealthy consumers.

Recommendation 2: **Improving online systems and business**

Home Depot has a rudimentary online system which limits its abilities to only servicing locally and with a limit of reach due to the costs of transportation as the weight of many of their products are high, limiting the abilities of delivery. However, this limitation can be surpassed by opening warehouses to store a higher inventory which will help them keep up with customer demand in the long run as well instead of entering a shortage the way they have currently. By accommodating more supply and having it ready to be retrieved if a nearby store needs it or if it needs to be utilized by the company in separate ways.

Recommendation 3: **Increase the amount of suppliers**

![](RackMultipart20230226-1-xvd3n9_html_f665f003fe10fdc4.png)

With the increasing amount of demand from consumers it becomes increasingly crucial for Home Depot to develop a greater number of suppliers to sustain the widespread ability to supply a multitude of products to consumers without having to specify in a single thing. This job can be made easier with facilities in Canada and Mexico which can be used for production of certain items due to the lower cost of labor when offshoring and can be further used to continue the company's goals which consist of building up goodwill in communities where home depots are locally set up.

_**U ![](RackMultipart20230226-1-xvd3n9_html_1f87b2147c5cc8ad.png) ltimately the main policy and strategy that we recommend to the company will be to do a combination of increasing suppliers to keep up with consumer demand as well as to increase development of the website and web sales to the consumers.**_ With these strategies in place the company can grow its supply and goodwill locally while continuing to keep up with the variety of consumer interest allowing for the development of a more simple and intercommunicating system with warehouses being used to store the increased supply. And with the now increased supply the company will be able to compete with other more specialized companies as well as similar competitors such as Lowes.
